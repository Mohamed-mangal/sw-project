The `cors()` middleware in Express is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for a server. When a website or web application is loaded from one domain, but requests resources from another domain, it is considered a cross-origin request. By default, browsers prohibit cross-origin requests due to security concerns. However, with the `cors()` middleware enabled, a server can explicitly allow cross-origin requests from specified origins. This is important in enabling various web-based applications to interact with each other and can improve the accessibility and usability of web services.
