The `express.json({limit: '50mb'})` middleware is used in an Express application to parse incoming request payloads in JSON format with a limit of 50 MB (megabytes). It is used to extract data from the body of an HTTP request encoded in JSON format.

By default, Express has a limit of 1mb for incoming payloads. If a request payload exceeds this limit, it will reject the request with an error. However, by specifying the `limit` property with a larger value, we can increase the maximum size of an HTTP request accepted by the server.

For example, to use the `express.json({limit: '50mb'})` middleware in an Express application, we can do the following:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// parse incoming JSON payloads with a limit of 50mb
app.use(express.json({limit: '50mb'}));

// other application routes and logic
// ...
```

This middleware should be used with caution and only in specific cases where large JSON data payloads need to be transmitted.
